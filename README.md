# Unit Converter
A simple Python-based unit conversion tool with both notebook implementations and a standalone desktop application.

## Repository Contents:
1. **Unit Converter - Linear Array.ipynb**  
   A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the base unit converter function.  
   It uses a linear-array approach to convert between units step by step.  

2. **UC_UI.ipynb**  
   A Jupyter Notebook that builds on the base converter, adding a Tkinter UI to make it more user-friendly.  

3. **UC_UI.exe**  
   A stand-alone executable version of the converter.  

## Using the Converters:
### Option 1: Notebooks
- Open the `.ipynb` files in Jupyter environment.  
- Run the cells (in order) to use the converter and UI.  

### Option 2: Executable
- Either download `UC_UI.exe` from the repository
- Or download the release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/gfpettifor/Unit-Converter/releases).  
- Then unzip the zipped folder and run `UC_UI.exe`.  

**Warning**: Since `UC_UI.exe` was created with PyInstaller, some antivirus software may falsely flag it as a threat. This is a common false positive. If that happens:
- Use the ZIP version provided under Releases, which usually avoids these warnings.  
- Or run the converter directly from the provided Python notebooks.
