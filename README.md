# Unit Converter
A simple Python-based unit conversion tool with both notebook implementations and a standalone desktop application.

## Repository Contents
1. **Unit Converter - Linear Array.ipynb**  
   A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the base unit converter function.  
   It uses a linear-array approach to convert between units step by step.  

2. **UC_UI.ipynb**  
   A Jupyter Notebook that builds on the base converter, adding a **Tkinter UI** for easier use.  

3. **UC_UI.exe**  
   A standalone executable version of the converter (built with PyInstaller).  

## üöÄ How to Use
### Option 1: Run the Notebooks
- Open the `.ipynb` files in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.  
- Run the cells to try out the converter logic and UI.  

### Option 2: Run the Executable
- Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/gfpettifor/Unit-Converter/releases).  
- Extract the ZIP archive.  
- Run `UC_UI.exe`.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Since this `.exe` was created with PyInstaller, some browsers or antivirus software may flag it as a potential threat. This is a common false positive. If that happens:
- Use the ZIP version provided under Releases, which usually avoids these warnings.  
- Or run the converter directly from the provided Python notebooks.  

## üì¶ Releases
You can always find the latest executable and ZIP files under [Releases](https://github.com/gfpettifor/Unit-Converter/releases).
